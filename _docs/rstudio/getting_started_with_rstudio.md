## RStudio IDE
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment that helps you be more productive with R. To use RStudio you need to first install R itself:

The lastest version of R can be installed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network `CRAN`: 

https://cran.r-project.org/

## Tutorials
Several good tutorials on starting with RStudio:

 - https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-r-rstudio/\

## Preview releases (daily builds)
For the brave and impatient:
RStudio releases its daily builds (test versions) on:

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/

Here you can review the latest changes and improvements of the IDE.

## Cheatsheets:
Cheatsheets are short comprehensive overviews of an application or package. They are a handy reference resource.
This link will download the pdf of the RStudio cheatsheet:
https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf

More cheatsheets that can of help to complement the contents of the course:

## RStudio IDE
Below we will show you a few tricks to be more productive with the RStudio IDE sofware. Figure \@ref(fig:rstudiointerface) shows the RStudio Interface on my computer while writing this website. The four windows that we use to work interactively with R are indicated by the big yellow numbers 1 to 4.


```r
 knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("images", "rstudio_interface.png"))
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="C:/Users/mteunis/workspaces/eda_moi/images/rstudio_interface.png" alt="The RStudio IDE interface. You can see the four windows here. They are explained below" width="640" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:rstudiointerface)The RStudio IDE interface. You can see the four windows here. They are explained below</p>
</div>


## The RStudio IDE Windows. 

 1. The **Script Editor Window**. If you use the default settings you will see this window appear in position 1 (figure \@ref(fig:rstudiointerface)) Here you can view the contents of files, and open and edit new script files. If no script editor is visible, but you only see something like below:
 
```

### <mark>**EXERCISE 1; Opening new script files**</mark> {-}

 A) Try openening a new R-Script by clicking `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script`. The new file will open up in the top-left window.
 
 B) Paste the following R code in you script file
 

```r
beaver_telemetry <- datasets::beaver1 %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = time, y = temp)) +
        geom_point(aes(colour = as_factor(activ))) +
        ggtitle("Body temperature of beavers")

beaver_telemetry
```

<img src="ch06-lab1aintrorstudio_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" />
 
C) Save the script as "beavers.R" in the ./code folder
 
D) See what happens if you execute the following code. What do you thinks happended here? How can you use this in an analysis workflow? _Discuss with your neighbour_


```r
## clear environment
rm(list=ls())

## source R script
source(
  here::here(
    "code",
    "beavers.R"
  )
)
```
 
 1. The Next window is the **Development** window to the right (position 2 in figure \@ref(fig:rstudiointerface)) contains the `Environment` and other `Development` tabs (like `Git` and `Build`). This window will show all the named variables that are available in the _current_ RSession. Clicking the little broom-stick icon will clear the environment. Some of the other tabs in this window (e.g. `Build`), we will encounter in chapters \@ref(lab3bfunctions) and \@ref(lab7bdeveloprpackages).
 
 1. The third window is the **Navigation** window. This window shows the files on your local storage (a kind of File Explorer) and we will also access the help documentation from this window. Importantly, plots and interactive views will also appear in window 3 under the `Plots` and `Viewer` tabs, respectively.
 
 1. The fourth window is the **Terminals** window. Mostly we will use the `Console` to either directly give a command to R or view the output of a comand. The tab that is named `Terminal` is actually the `System` terminal. On the server this Terminal provides access to the operating system of the server (Windows 10 x64 (build 18362)). In the Terminal you can inspect files directly by using the `head` command or execute other `Bash` commands. Having an R Console and a System Terminal available in one application makes RStudio execeptionally suitable for developing packages for R. An additional feature of this window is the `Jobs` pane. This enables you to run R-scripts as background jobs. This allows you to continue working on a script, while executing another script simultaneously, without crashing R or your computer (VM).  

### <mark>**EXERCISE 2; System terminal**</mark> {-}

To start a new `Terminal`: `Tools` -> `Terminal` -> `New Terminal`
A) Try it below and copy (Ctrl + C), paste (Shift + Insert) the following Bash code in your new `Terminal`

For example we can see the first lines of the file alijn.tsv by running the following code in the Linux Terminal:

```
head -30 data/allijn.tsv
```

## Global Settings 
To adapt the appearance of your editor, provide a LaTeX interpreter, or set a mirror for CRAN you go to `Tools` -> `Global Options`

To change the theme: `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Appearance` -> Choose an `Editor Theme` that is appealing to you. Dark background is most relaxing for your eyes.

Edit the setting that forces output to inline in RMarkdown documents under the `R Markdown` panel. Uncheck the "Show output in-line for all RMarkdown documents" -> Click `Apply`. 

## Restarting R 
If you are really stuck. If R hangs, restart R by: `Session` -> `Restart R`
If login into the RStudio Server fails, send me an email, I will reset your account for you

## Code style and reformat
Writing computer code needs to adhere to convention, in R specically for humans reading the code. R does not care about indentations or white lines or braces on the wrong line. But adhering to a style convention makes code easier for humans to consume. For more on code style for R: 

[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

If your code looks like a mess: Select your code -> click `Code` and than `Reformat Code`, it will change 'youR' life
 1. If you find the inline output in Rmarkdown files (output will apear under the code chunk) as annoying as me: Click `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> select the `R Markdown` tab, than uncheck the checkbox for "Show output inline for all RMarkdown documents" 

## Shortcut keys
Shortcut keys are very handy, the prevent clicking and increase speed: you can access all by viewing `Tools` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts Help`, modify them with the `Modify Keyboard Shortcuts`

## New File
You can create new files under `File`. Choose from the list the file type that you want to create.

## R-scripts

 - R-script; used to run single actions, functions, cleaning, file-managment, a single graph or automated actions. 
 - Use `source("path_to_r_script") to call an individual script. 
 - Runs begin-to-end, can contain dependencies on other files
 - Exercises have to be made in RMarkdown during the course. 
 - It is a very flexible and multi-pupose format to combine code, text and code-output in one product
 - Suitable to generate different formats: MS Word, MS Power Point, HTML Slide shows, PDF, HTML documents, Websites, Blogs, Books
 - Able to include different types of code chunks: R, Python, Bash, Stan, Perl etc. Out of scope of this course

## The `stick-broom` icon 
You will find the `stick-broom` in other panes in RStudio as well, it clears the object in the `Plots` and the `Viewer` panes respectively.

## Reading data - RStudio help
To read data RStudio has an interactive help: 
Choose `File` -> `Import Dataset` -> `From Text (readr)` or the appropriate file type

 - Choose the file that you want to import under the `Browse` button
 - An interactive Console will appear, choose the right settings such as headers on/off, delimiter etc. 
 - Much like in the import function from Excel you will see a preview of the datatable.  - In the bottom right corner the appropriate R code is displayed. 
 - You can copy that code to the clipboard and paste it into a script.
 - Now execute the script and the datafile loads. 
 - If you want you can first adapt the variable name that is chosen to store the dataframe in


### <mark>**EXERCISE 3; Load data**</mark> {-}

A) Try to load the datafile "/data/kiemingen.xlsx" by the way described above.
Think about why you should copy - paste the R-code to a script o Rmd code chunk to load a file!?

B) Run the command `str(kiemingen)` in the console. What do think this command does and why is it relevant for data load?

### <mark>**EXERCISE 4; Appearance and general settings**</mark> {-}

A) Try adjusting the appearance of you RStudo so that it matches mine (I use the theme `Merbivore`)

B) Create an new .Rmd file. This file contains an example, using the MT cars dataset.
Type 

Click the Run drop-down and select `Run All` button and see what happens. Save this Rmd file as "my_first_rmd.rmd" in the ./code folder

C) In the `global options` unselect the option "Show output inline for all Rmd documents" in the Rmd panel.  

D) Click `Run All` again when you are in the "my_first_rmd.Rmd" file, do you see the difference? where does the output of the R code go now? 

## Git integration
RStudio comes with a build-in integration with Git. This enables collaboration, continuous integration of data-products such as Shiny apps and bookdown websites. Furthermore it increases reproducibility and tracebility of code and data-analysis.

Below we will go over an exercise to learn how to use this integration with Git.
Part of the material for this exercise was taken from:

[Happy Git & Github With R](https://happygitwithr.com/)

### <mark>**EXERCISE 5; Integration with Github.com**</mark> {-}

 1. Create an account on Github, if you did not already do so.
 1. Create a new repository called 'Perceptor', initialize this repo with a README file
 1. From this repository, create a new RStudio Project on the server
 1. Add the file "./code/my_first_rmd.rmd" to this project in the root
 1. Commit you changes in the `Git` panel of the `Development` window
 1. Push the commit to you remote repository on Github
 1. Look at the online (remote) version of the repo
 1. Now go back to the 'Perceptor' RStudio project
 1. Add the following code to your "my_first_rmd.Rmd" in a code chunk at the end.
 
 ```r
 beaver_telemetry <- datasets::beaver1 %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = time, y = temp)) +
        geom_point(aes(colour = as_factor(activ))) +
        ggtitle("Body temperature of beavers")
 
 beaver_telemetry
 ```
 1. Click the `Knit` button
 1. Commit the changes by looking at the `Git` panel
 1. Puch your commit to yor remote repo
 1. Review the contents of your repo and discuss the changes with your neighbour

## Workflow
The RStudio --> Git --> Github workflow can be summarized in the following graph


```r
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  'RStudio Project' -> 'Commit' 
  'RStudio Project' -> 'Local Git repo' 
  'Local Git repo' -> 'Remote Github repo'}")
```

<!--html_preserve--><div id="htmlwidget-5ac8e4191071c58925a8" style="width:672px;height:480px;" class="grViz html-widget"></div>

## DiagrammaR
The `{DiagrammaR}` package is a great tool for drawing any type of diagram from within R. Drawing a diagram with code is a good idea because you do not have to wory about formatting and alignment and it let's you recycle parts of your diagram. As always, it will require some upfront investment of time to figure things out, but it will pay back in the end and is more fun than fussing over details in a diagram in PowerPoint.

```r
###
# Perform traversals with conditions
# based on node `label` regex matches

library(DiagrammeR)
library(magrittr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'magrittr'

# Create a graph with fruit, vegetables,
# and nuts
df <- data.frame(col1 = c("Cat", "Dog", "Bird"),
                 col2 = c("Feline", "Canis", "Avis"),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
uniquenodes <- unique(c(df$col1, df$col2))

uniquenodes
```

```
## [1] "Cat"    "Dog"    "Bird"   "Feline" "Canis"  "Avis"
```

```r

                        type="number", 
                        label=uniquenodes)
edges <- create_edge_df(from=match(df$col1, uniquenodes), 
                        to=match(df$col2, uniquenodes), 
                        rel="related")
g <- create_graph(nodes_df=nodes, 
                  edges_df=edges)
render_graph(g)
```
